TODO's for the auto-tmux project

- [ ] add an exit key for yaml configs. it will exit the window/pane as soon as the command finishes.
- [ ] add session editing.
- [ ] add a variables to the yaml. so the user can say, "give me a tmux session called Foo with configuration in bar.yaml", that kind of thing
- [x] ~~add a way to not specify the workdir in the config files. if not spicified auto-tmux should use the current working dir~~ this was already the case but now it's more explicit
